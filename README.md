# Fullstack development notes

Welcome to the **Fullstack Development Notes**! This repository is a personal collection of workshops, guides, and notes designed to help me (and hopefully others) stay up to date with modern fullstack development practices.

> Note: Originally named Frontend Community Workshops Archive, this repository began as a collection of frontend-focused materials created during my time at [OVO Energy](https://www.ovoenergy.com)/[Kaluza](https://www.kaluza.com/) between 2019 and 2022). It served as a fantastic way to learn, document, and share knowledge. As I transition toward fullstack development, I aim to update these materials with modern practices, add backend and infrastructure-focused content, and explore new areas of interest.
